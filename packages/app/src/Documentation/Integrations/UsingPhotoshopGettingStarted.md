# Getting Started with Stability for Photoshop {#photoshop-addon-getting-started}

After you've installed the plugin, open a new document in Photoshop - the document size doesn't matter. You should see a tab for the Stability plugin in your UI - it will look like this:

If you don't see it, navigate to Plugins > Stable Diffusion:

![](/Photoshop/select_addon.png)

Enter your API key - you can get one [here](https://dreamstudio.ai/account). Press 'Save', then navigate to the 'Stable Diffusion' tab at the top. Afterward, you should see this:
