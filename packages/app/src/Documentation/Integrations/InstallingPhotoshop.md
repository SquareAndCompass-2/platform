# Installing Stability for Photoshop {#photoshop-addon}

There are two ways to get the latest version of the Stability Photoshop Plugin:

- [Install it from the Adobe Exchange](https://exchange.adobe.com/apps/cc/114117da/stable-diffusion).
- [Download the CCX file directly](https://christiancantrell.com/downloads/venus-vision/ps-plugin-stable-diffusion/StableDiffusion-0.9.0.ccx).

3. Open Photoshop.
4. Double-click on the CCX file you downloaded.

### Local Inference Options {#local-inference}
