# Installing Stability for Blender {#installing-blender}

This guide will walk you though installing the Stability for Blender addon.

1. First, download the latest release of Blender from [here](https://www.blender.org/download/), then go to the [Addon Releases](https://github.com/Stability-AI/stability-blender-addon-public/releases/) page. Click the 'stability-blender-addon' link (and not the source code link):
