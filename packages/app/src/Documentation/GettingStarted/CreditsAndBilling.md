# üí∞ Credits + Billing

Credits are required to use [DreamStudio](https://dreamstudio.ai) or the API.

All new users are granted `25` free credits upon creating an account.

## What is a Credit? {#what-is-a-credit}

A credit is a unit of currency expended when generating images with [DreamStudio](https://dreamstudio.ai). Credit usage scales according to the compute required to generate your image.

Your `25` initial free credits represent `30` images generated at DreamStudio's default settings and `50` images with the API's default settings.

## Buying Credits {#buying-credits}
