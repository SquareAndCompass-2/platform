# ðŸ’° Credits + Billing

Credits are required to use [DreamStudio](https://dreamstudio.ai) or the API.

All new users are granted `25` free credits upon creating an account.

## What is a Credit? {#what-is-a-credit}

A credit is a unit of currency expended when generating images with [DreamStudio](https://dreamstudio.ai). Credit usage scales according to the compute required to generate your image.

## Buying Credits {#buying-credits}

After depleting your free credits, additional credits can be purchased via your [Billing](/account/billing) dashboard.

## Credit Usage {#credit-usage}

Credit usage scales according to the step count and the pixel dimensions of your request. Refer to the [Pricing](/pricing) page to view the formulas for calculating credit usage for specific models.

The API defaults to `512 x 512` Pixels and `30` Steps, which differs in comparison to DreamStudio, where the default is `512 x 512` Pixels and `50` Steps.
