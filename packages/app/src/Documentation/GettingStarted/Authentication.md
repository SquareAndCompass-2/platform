# 🔒 Authentication

To make calls against the API, you'll first need to create an account with us, and then obtain an API key.

Access to your API keys can then be managed [on the account page](/account/keys).

All [Stability AI](/account) accounts are assigned a default API key on creation.

In the `API Keys` panel you'll see a listing of all active API keys for your account.

Copy the contents of any key you'd like to use by clicking `Copy`.

> 🚨 Your API key needs to be kept secret. Avoid committing your secrets to source control. Someone could drain your credits if your key is compromised! If you suspect your key has been leaked, first create a new one from your [Account](/account) page, and then delete the old one.

## 🔐 Next Steps {#next-steps}

Exact usage of the API will vary across programming languages and clients.

Refer to your client-specific documentation to learn how to use your API key.
