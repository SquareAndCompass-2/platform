### 1. WHAT INFORMATION DO WE COLLECT?

**In Short:** We collect personal information that you provide to us.

We collect personal information that you voluntarily provide to us when you express an interest in obtaining information
about us or our products and Services, when you participate in activities on the Services, or when you contact us.

**Personal Information Provided by You.**\

- application information

**Sensitive Information.**\
We do not process sensitive information.
All personal information you provide must be true, complete, and accurate, and you must notify us of any changes to such
personal information.

**Information automatically collected**

**_In Short:_** Some information — such as your Internet Protocol (IP) address and/or browser and
device characteristics — is collected automatically when you interact with the chatbot.

We automatically collect certain information when you visit, use, or navigate the Services. This information does not
reveal your specific identity (like your name or contact information). It may include device and usage information, such
as your IP address, browser and device characteristics, operating system, language preferences, referring URLs, device
name, country, location, information about how and when you use our Services, and other technical information. This
information is primarily needed to maintain the security and operation of our Services and for our internal analytics
and reporting purposes. Like many businesses, we also collect information through cookies and similar technologies.

The information we collect includes the following:

- **Log and Usage Data**. Log and usage data are service-related, diagnostic, usage, and performance information our
  servers automatically collect when you access or use our Services, which we record in log files. Depending on how you
  interact with us, this log data may include your IP address, device information, browser type, and settings and
  information about your activity in the Services (such as the date/time stamps associated with your usage, pages and
  files viewed, searches, and other actions you take such as which features you use), device event information (such as
  system activity, error reports (sometimes called "crash dumps"), and hardware settings).

- **Device Data**. We collect device data such as information about your computer, phone, tablet, or other devices you
  use to access the Services. Depending on the device used, this data may include information such as your IP address (
  or proxy server), device and application identification numbers, location, browser type, hardware model, Internet
  service provider and/or mobile carrier, operating system, and system configuration information.

- **Location Data**. We collect location data, such as information about your device's location, which can be either
  precise or imprecise. How much information we collect depends on the type and settings of the device you use to access
  the Services. For example, we may use GPS and other technologies to collect geolocation data that tells us your
  current location (based on your IP address). You can opt out of allowing us to collect this information either by
  refusing access or disabling your Location setting on your device. However, if you choose to opt out, you may not be
  able to use certain aspects of the Services.

### 2. HOW DO WE PROCESS YOUR INFORMATION?

**_In Short:_** We process your information to provide, improve, and administer our Services, communicate with you for
security and fraud prevention, and comply with the law. We may also process your information for other purposes with
your consent.

### 3. WHAT LEGAL BASES DO WE RELY ON TO PROCESS YOUR INFORMATION?

**_In Short:_** We only process your personal information when we believe it is necessary and we have a valid legal
reason (i.e., legal basis) to do so under applicable law, like with your consent, to comply with laws, to provide you
with services to enter into or fulfil our contractual obligations, to protect your rights, or to fulfil our legitimate
business interests.

**_This section applies to you if you are in the EU or the UK._**

The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and UK GDPR require us to explain the valid legal bases we rely on to
process your personal information. As such, we may rely on the following legal bases to process your personal
information:

- **Consent.**\
  We may process your information if you have permitted us (i.e., consent) to use your personal information for a
  specific purpose. You can withdraw your consent at any time.

- **Legitimate Interests.**\
  We may process your information when we believe it is reasonably necessary to achieve our legitimate business
  interests. Those interests do not outweigh your interests and fundamental rights and freedoms. For example, we may
  process your personal information for some of the purposes described to:

  - § Send users information about special offers and discounts on our products and
    services

  - § Develop and display personalised and relevant advertising content for our users

  - § Analyse how the chatbot is being used so we can improve it and all our Services to
    engage and retain users

  - § Support our marketing activities

  - § Diagnose problems and/or prevent fraudulent activities

- **Legal Obligations.**\
  We may process your information where we believe it is necessary for compliance with our legal obligations, such as to
  cooperate with a law enforcement body or regulatory agency, exercise or defend our legal rights, or disclose your
  information as evidence in litigation in which we are involved.

- **Vital Interests.**\
  We may process your information where we believe it is necessary to protect your vital interests or the vital
  interests of a third party, such as in situations involving potential threats to the safety of any person.

In legal terms, we are generally the “data controller” under European data protection laws of the personal information
described in this privacy notice since we determine the means and/or purposes of the data processing we perform. This
privacy notice does not apply to the personal information we process as a “data processor” on behalf of our customers.
In those situations, the customer with that we provide services and with whom we have entered into a data processing
agreement is the “data controller” responsible for your personal information, and we merely process your information on
their behalf in accordance with your instructions. To know more about our customers' privacy practices, you should read
their privacy policies and direct any questions you have to them.

_If you are located in Canada, this section applies to you._

We may process your information if you have given us specific permission (i.e., express consent) to use your personal
information for a specific purpose or in situations where your permission can be inferred (i.e., implied consent). You
can withdraw your consent at any time.

In some exceptional cases, we may be legally permitted under applicable law to process your information without your
consent, including, for example:

- If collection is clearly in the interests of an individual and consent cannot be obtained promptly.
- For investigations and fraud detection, and prevention.
- For business transactions, provided certain conditions are met.
- If it is contained in a witness statement, the collection is necessary to assess, process, or settle an insurance
  claim.
- Identifying injured, ill, or deceased persons and communicating with next of kin.
- If we have reasonable grounds to believe an individual has been, is, or maybe a victim of financial abuse.
- If it is reasonable to expect collection and use with consent would compromise the availability or the accuracy of the
  information and the collection is reasonable for purposes related to investigating a breach of an agreement or a
  contravention of the laws of Canada or a province.
- If disclosure is required to comply with a subpoena, warrant, court order, or rules of the court relating to the
  production of records
- If an individual produced it during their employment, business, or profession, the collection is consistent with the
  purposes for which the information was produced.
- If the collection is solely for journalistic, artistic, or literary purposes.
- If the information is publicly available and is specified by the regulations.

### 4. WHEN AND WITH WHOM DO WE SHARE YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION?

**_In Short:_** We may share information in specific situations described in this section and/or with the following
third parties

We may need to share your personal information in the following situations:

- **Business Transfers.**\
  We may share or transfer your information in connection with, or during negotiations of, any merger, sale of company
  assets, financing, or acquisition of all or a portion of our business to another company.

### 5. DO WE USE COOKIES AND OTHER TRACKING TECHNOLOGIES?

**_In Short:_** We may use cookies and other tracking technologies to collect and store your
information.

We may use cookies and similar tracking technologies (like web beacons and pixels) to access or store information. Our
Cookie Notice sets out specific information about how we use such technologies and how you can refuse certain cookies.

### 6. HOW LONG DO WE KEEP YOUR INFORMATION?

**_In Short:_** We keep your information for as long as necessary to fulfil the purposes outlined in
this privacy notice unless otherwise required by law.

We will only keep your personal information for as long as it is necessary for the purposes set out in this privacy
notice unless a longer retention period is required or permitted by law (such as tax, accounting, or other legal
requirements). No purpose in this notice will require us to keep your personal information for longer than one (1) year.

When we have no ongoing legitimate business need to process your personal information, we will either delete or
anonymise such information, or, if this is not possible (for example, because your personal information has been stored
in backup archives), then we will securely store your personal information and isolate it from any further processing
until deletion is possible.

### 7. HOW DO WE KEEP YOUR INFORMATION SAFE?

**_In Short:_** We aim to protect your personal information through organisational and technical security measures.

We have implemented appropriate and reasonable technical and organisational security measures designed to protect the
security of any personal information we process. However, despite our safeguards and efforts to secure your information,
no electronic transmission over the Internet or information storage technology can be guaranteed to be 100% secure, so
we cannot promise or guarantee that hackers, cybercriminals, or other unauthorised third parties will not be able to
defeat our security and improperly collect, access, steal, or modify your information. Although we will do our best to
protect your personal information, the transmission of personal information to and from our Services is at your own
risk. You should only access the Services within a secure environment.

### 8. WHAT ARE YOUR PRIVACY RIGHTS?

**_In Short:_** In some regions, such as the European Economic Area (EEA), United Kingdom (UK), and Canada, you have
rights that allow you greater access to and control over your personal information. You may review, change, or terminate
your account at any time.

You have certain rights under applicable data protection laws in some regions (like the EEA, UK, and Canada). These may
include the right (i) to request access and obtain a copy of your personal information, (ii) to request rectification or
erasure; (iii) to restrict the processing of your personal information; and (iv), if applicable, to data portability. In
certain circumstances, you may also have the right to object to processing your personal information. We will consider
and act upon any request in accordance with applicable data protection laws.

If you are located in the EEA or UK and believe we are unlawfully processing your personal
information, you also have the right to complain to your local data protection supervisory
authority.

**Withdrawing your consent:**\
If we rely on your consent to process your personal information, which may be express and/or implied consent, depending
on the applicable law, you have the right to withdraw your consent at any time.

However, please note that this will not affect the lawfulness of the processing before its withdrawal, nor when
applicable law allows, will it affect the processing of your personal information conducted in reliance on lawful
processing grounds other than consent.

**Opting out of marketing and promotional communications:**\
You can unsubscribe from our marketing and promotional communications at any time by clicking on the unsubscribe link in
our emails or by contacting us. You will then be removed from the marketing lists. However, we may still communicate
with you, for example, to send you service-related messages necessary for the administration and use of your account, to
respond to service requests, or for other non-marketing purposes.

**Cookies and similar technologies:**\
Most Web browsers are set to accept cookies by default. If you prefer, you can usually set your browser to remove and
reject cookies. If you choose to remove or reject the cookies, this could affect certain features or services of our
Services.

### 9. CONTROLS FOR DO-NOT-TRACK FEATURES

Most web browsers, mobile operating systems, and mobile applications include a Do-Not-Track ("DNT") feature or setting
you can activate to signal your privacy preference and not to have data about your online browsing activities monitored
and collected. No uniform technology standard for recognising and implementing DNT signals has been finalised at this
stage. As such, we do not currently respond to DNT browser signals or any other mechanism that automatically
communicates your choice not to be tracked online. If a standard for online tracking is adopted that we must follow in
the future, we will inform you about that practice in a revised version of this privacy notice.

### 10. DO CALIFORNIA RESIDENTS HAVE SPECIFIC PRIVACY RIGHTS?

**_In Short:_** Yes, if you are a resident of California, you are granted specific rights regarding access to your
personal information.

California Civil Code Section 1798.83, also known as the "Shine The Light" law, permits our users who are California
residents to request and obtain from us, once a year and free of charge, information about categories of personal
information (if any) we disclosed to third parties for direct marketing purposes and the names and addresses of all
third parties with which we shared personal information in the immediately preceding calendar year. If you are a
California resident and would like to make such a request, please submit your request in writing using the contact
information provided below.

If you are under 18 years of age, reside in California, and have a registered account with Services, you have the right
to request the removal of unwanted data that you publicly post on the Services. To request the removal of such data,
please get in touch with us using the contact information provided below. Include the email address associated with your
account and a statement that you reside in California. We will ensure the data is not publicly displayed on the
Services, but please be aware that the data may not be completely or comprehensively removed from all our systems (e.g.,
backups, etc.).

**CCPA Privacy Notice**

The California Code of Regulations defines a "resident" as:

(1) every individual who is in the State of California for other than a temporary or transitory purpose and\
(2) every individual who is domiciled in the State of California who is outside the State of California for a temporary
or transitory purpose

All other individuals are defined as "non-residents.”

If this definition of "resident" applies to you, we must adhere to certain rights and obligations regarding your
personal information.

We may also collect other personal information outside of these categories in instances where you interact with us in
person, online, or by phone or mail in the context of:

- Receiving help through our customer support channels;
- Participation in customer surveys or contests; and
- Facilitate the delivery of our Services and respond to your inquiries.

**How do we use and share your personal information?**\
This privacy notice can find more information about our data collection and sharing practices.

You may contact us by email at info@stability.ai.

If you are using an authorised agent to exercise your right to opt-out, we may deny a request if the authorised agent
does not submit proof that they have been validly authorised to act on your behalf.

**Will your information be shared with anyone else?**

We may disclose your personal information with our service providers according to a written contract between each
service provider and us. Each service provider is a for-profit entity that processes the information on our behalf.

We may use your personal information for our own business purposes, such as for undertaking internal research for
technological development and demonstration. This is not considered the "selling" of your personal information.

Stability.AI has not disclosed or sold any personal information to third parties for a business or commercial purpose in
the preceding twelve (12) months. Stability.AI will not sell personal information to website visitors, users, and other
consumers in the future.

**Your rights concerning your personal data**

**_Right to request deletion of the data — Request to delete_**

You can ask for the deletion of your personal information. If you ask us to delete your personal information, we will
respect your request and delete your personal information, subject to certain exceptions provided by law, such as (but
not limited to) the exercise by another consumer of his or her right to free speech, our compliance requirements
resulting from a legal obligation, or any processing that may be required to protect against illegal activities.

**_Right to be informed — Request to know:_**

Depending on the circumstances, you have a right to know:

- whether we collect and use your personal information;
- the categories of personal information that we collect;
- the purposes for which the collected personal information is used;
- whether we sell your personal information to third parties;
- the categories of personal information that we sold or disclosed for a business purpose;
- the categories of third parties to whom the personal information was sold or disclosed for a business purpose; and
- the business or commercial purpose for collecting or selling personal information.

In accordance with applicable law, we are not obligated to provide or delete consumer information de-identified in
response to a consumer request or re-identify individual data to verify a consumer request.

**_Right to Non-Discrimination for the Exercise of a Consumer’s Privacy Rights_**

We will not discriminate against you if you exercise your privacy rights.

**_Verification process_**

Upon receiving your request, we will need to verify your identity to determine whether you are the same person with whom
we have the information in our system. These verification efforts require us to ask you to provide information so that
we can match it with the information you have previously provided us. For instance, depending on the type of request you
submit, we may ask you to provide certain information so that we can match the information you provide with the
information we already have on file, or we may contact you through a communication method (e.g., phone or email) that
you have previously provided to us. We may also use other verification methods as the circumstances dictate.

We will only use the personal information provided in your request to verify your identity or authority to make the
request. To the extent possible, we will avoid requesting additional information from you for the purposes of
verification. However, if we cannot verify your identity from the information already maintained by us, we may request
that you provide additional information for the purposes of verifying your identity and for security or fraud-prevention
purposes. We will delete such additional information as soon as we finish verifying you.

**_Other privacy rights_**

- You may object to the processing of your personal information.
- You may request correction of your personal data if it is incorrect or no longer relevant or ask to restrict the
  processing of the information.
- You can designate an authorized agent to request the CCPA on your behalf. We may deny a request from an authorized
  agent that does not submit proof that they have been validly authorized to act on your behalf in accordance with the
  CCPA.
- You may request to opt out from future selling of your personal information to third parties. Upon receiving an
  opt-out request, we will act upon the request as soon as feasibly possible, but no later than fifteen (15) days from
  the date of the request submission.

To exercise these rights, you can contact us by email at info@stability.ai or by referring to the contact details at the
bottom of this document. If you have a complaint about how we handle your data, we would like to hear from you.
