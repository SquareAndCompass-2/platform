Your `200` initial free credits represent anywhere from `1,000` to `10` images depending on the settings used.

## Buying Credits {#buying-credits}

Once you've depleted your credits, you can purchase more through your [DreamStudio](https://dreamstudio.pages.dev/membership?tab=home) account.

Credits are most easily purchased in `$10` increments, however, you can make higher volume purchases through the `API Partners` section of [DreamStudio](https://beta.dreamstudio.ai/membership?tab=home)...
