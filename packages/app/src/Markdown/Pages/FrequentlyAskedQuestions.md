### Stable diffusion is open source, why does the API cost money?

While the Stable Diffusion model has been made open source by Stability AI, the DreamStudio website is a service we are designing to enable anyone to access this powerful creative tool without the need for software installation, coding knowledge, or a heavy-duty local GPU.

### Do I own the images I create?

Yes! All images generated via the Stability AI API are owned by you. For the complete legal description of our policy, please refer to our [Terms of Service](https://platform.stability.ai/legal/terms-of-service).

### Why are some of my images blurred?

The Stability AI API is designed to generate images that are safe for public consumption. This means that the model will blur out any content that may be considered inappropriate or offensive.

**You will not be charged credits for blurred results**

If you are unhappy with the results, you can always try again with a different prompt.
